/* Program: seqmax.c
* Author: Marc Smith *
* Description:
* Write a program that finds the max of N numbers.
* The program will prompt the user for a list of
* numbers, which will be read from stdin using
* the C library function, scanf().
*
* This is a first program in C. While the problem
* is simple, many core features of the language
* will be mastered along the way. *
* This program will use arrays, which in C are
* just pointers. You will write three versions of
* the program, one using array notation ( []'s ),
* a second using pointers ( * ), and a third using
* dynamic memory allocation. */

/*
* initialize n elements of numbers array to -1 */
void init_numbers(int n, int* numbers)
{ // you fill in the body! 
}
/*
* read numbers from stdin */
int read_numbers(int* numbers) { // you fill in the body! 
}
/*
* print n elements of given array */
void print_numbers(int n, int* numbers) { // you fill in the body!
}
/*
* find max from first n numbers in given array */
int find_max(int n, int* numbers) { // you fill in the body!
}

int main() {
// you fill in the body!
}
